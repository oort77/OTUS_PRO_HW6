**Goals:**  

1. Download and clean "Metropolitan Interstate Traffic Volume" dataset;
2. Explore data;
3. Engineer additional features;
4. Build a baseline model - average by day of week and hour;
5. Build and test a number of models and compare results with the baseline;
6. Make predictions of temperature for test set and use it in model;
7. Visualize best model  with confidence intervals.

**Means**:

- All time series exploration and prognosis are done with [Pycaret-ts-alpha](https://pypi.org/project/pycaret-ts-alpha)  library

**Data source**:

    [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume)
